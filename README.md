# Machine-Learning-Capstone

The main task of this project is to create an application which classifies user inputted pictures of wild mushrooms according to their species, using a machine learning classifier based on a convolutional neural network. In result the application calculates the probability for each species of mushrooms, the image may belongs to.

# Important Note

The project is not about the decision whether a mushroom is edible or not. Instead the application should help to understand the biodiversity of mushrooms in Central European forest areas.<br>
